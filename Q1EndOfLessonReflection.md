## 1.) Topics I Know Well

1. JavaScript Overview and Syntax Rules:
I understand JavaScript syntax because it resembles Python and C++. Knowing where to put semicolons,
braces, and parentheses helps me avoid errors, and once I got used to it, writing code became easier.

2. Variable Declaration (var, let, console.log):
I’m confident declaring variables. I know var is older, let is block-scoped, and console.log shows
output in the console. This keeps my code clear and organized.

3. Arithmetic and Assignment Operations:
JavaScript operators are familiar since they’re like those in Python and C++. I know how to use
+, -, \*, /, %, and also +=, -=, \*=. These are useful for calculations and updating values.

4. If–Else Control Statements:
I understand if, else if, and else. They let me write code that makes decisions based on conditions,
similar to what I learned in Python and C++.

5. For and While Loops:
I know how loops work and how they save time when repeating tasks. We
practiced multiplication tables and sequences, so I got used to using them in JavaScript.


## 2.) Topics I Know but Need Practice With

1. Functions:
I know how to define and call functions, but I sometimes get confused with parameters and return
values. I need more practice writing and reusing them.

2. Arrays and Indexing:
I know arrays store multiple values, but I sometimes forget that indexing starts at zero. This
causes mistakes when looping through them.

3. Nested Loops:
I understand the idea, but I get mixed up when printing patterns. It’s easy to lose track of which
loop controls what.

4. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !):
I know they combine conditions, but I still get confused when both must be true versus when only
one must be true.

5. Switch Statements:
I know the structure, but I often forget the break keyword. Without it, the program runs all cases,
which causes errors.


## 3.) Plan to Improve

To get better, I’ll write small programs focused on each topic. For functions, I’ll practice return
values with console.log. For arrays, I’ll loop through elements until I get indexing right. For nested
loops, I’ll build simple patterns step by step. For logical operators, I’ll test different conditions.
For switch statements, I’ll practice short examples until I remember to use break.


## 4.) Class Activities

Effective:

1.) Hands-on coding tasks helped me apply lessons immediately.
2.) Live coding demos from the teacher made the concepts much clearer.

Not Effective:

1.) Copy-pasting code without explanation wasn’t useful since I didn’t understand it fully.
2.) Rushed activities made it harder to follow along and learn the steps.
